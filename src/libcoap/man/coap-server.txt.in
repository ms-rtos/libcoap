              [*-A* address] [*-N*]

              [*-S* match_pki_sni_file]]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*coap-server* is an example server for the 'Constrained Application Protocol`
(RFC 7252).

OPTIONS - General
-----------------
*-d* max::
   Enable support for creation of dynamic resources when doing a PUT up to a
   limit of 'max'.  If 'max' is reached, a 4.06 code is returned until one of
   the dynamic resources has been deleted.

*-g* group::
   Join specified multicast 'group' on start up.

*-l* list::
   Fail to send some datagrams specified by a comma separated list of
   numbers or number ranges (debugging only).

*-l* loss%::
   Randomly failed to send datagrams with the specified probability - 100%
   all datagrams, 0% no datagrams (debugging only).

*-p* port::
   The 'port' on the given address will be listening for incoming connections.
   If (D)TLS is supported, then 'port' + 1 will also be listened on for
   (D)TLS connections.
   The default port is 5683 if not given any other value.

*-v* num::
   The verbosity level to use (default 3, maximum is 9). Above 7, there is
   increased verbosity in GnuTLS and OpenSSL logging.

*-A* address::
   The local address of the interface which the server has to listen on.

*-N* ::
   Send NON-confirmable message for "observe" responses. If option *-N* is
   not specified, a confirmable response will be sent.  Even if set, every
   fifth response will still be sent as a confirmable response
   (RFC 7641 requirement).

OPTIONS - PSK
-------------
(If supported by underlying (D)TLS library)

*-h* hint::
   Identity hint to use for inbound connections. The default is 'CoAP'.
   This cannot be empty if defined.

*-i* match_identiity_file::
   This option denotes a file that contains one or more lines of client Hints
   and (user) Identities to match for a new Pre-Shared key (PSK)
   (comma separated) to be used.
   E.g., entry per line +
   hint_to_match,identity_to_match,new_key +
   A line that starts with # is treated as a comment. +
   Note: -k still needs to be defined for the default case +

*-k* key::
   Pre-shared key to use for inbound connections. This cannot be empty if
   defined.
   *Note:* if *-c cafile* is defined, you need to define *-k key* as well to
   have the server support both PSK and PKI.

*-s* match_psk_sni_file::
   This option denotes a file that contains one or more lines of Subject Name
   Identifier (SNI) to match for new Identity Hint and new Pre-Shared Key
   (PSK) (comma separated) to be used.
   E.g., entry per line +
   sni_to_match,new_hint,new_key +
   A line that starts with # is treated as a comment. +
   Note: -k still needs to be defined for the default case +
   Note: the new Pre-Shared Key will get updated if there is also a -i match

OPTIONS - PKI
-------------
(If supported by underlying (D)TLS library)

*-c* certfile::
   Use the specified PEM file which contains the CERTIFICATE and PRIVATE
   KEY information.
   *Note:* if *-k key* is defined, you need to define *-c cafile* as well to
   have the server support both PSK and PKI.

*-n* ::
   Disable the requirement for clients to have defined client certificates.

*-C* cafile::
  PEM file containing the CA Certificate that was used to sign the certfile
  defined using *-c certfile*.
  If defined, then the client will be given this CA Certificate during the TLS
  set up. Furthermore, this will trigger the validation of the client
  certificate. If certfile is self-signed (as defined by *-c certfile*), then
  you need to have on the command line the same filename for both the certfile
  and cafile (as in  *-c certfile -C certfile*) to trigger validation.

*-R* root_cafile::
  PEM file containing the set of trusted root CAs that are to be used to
  validate the server certificate.  The *-C cafile* does not have to be in
  this list and is "trusted" for the verification.
  Alternatively, this can point to a directory containing a set of CA PEM files.

*-S* match_pki_sni_file::
   This option denotes a file that contains one or more lines of Subject Name
   Identifier (SNI) to match for new Certificate File and new CA File (comma
   separated) to be used. E.g., entry per line +
   sni_to_match,new_cert_file,new_ca_file +
   A line that starts with # is treated as a comment. +
   Note: *-c certfile* and *-C cafile* still needs to be defined for the
   default case

EXAMPLES
--------
* Example
----
coap-server -A ::1
----
Let the server listen on localhost (port '5683').

* Example
----
coap-server -A ::1 -k mysecretKey -h myhint
----
Let the server listen on localhost (port '5683' and '5684') with the server
set up for PSK authentication.

* Example
----
coap-server -A ::1 -p 13011
----
The same, except the listening port is '13011' (and not the default port
'5683').

* Example
----
coap-server -A 2001:db8:81a8:0:6ef0:dead:feed:beef -v 5
----
The listening address is set to '2001:db8:81a8:0:6ef0:dead:feed:beef' and the
verbosity level is set to '5'.

* Example
----
coap-server -A 2001:db8:81a8:0:6ef0:dead:feed:beef -g FF02::FD
----
Set listening address to '2001:db8:81a8:0:6ef0:dead:feed:beef' and join the
All CoAP Nodes multicast group 'FF02::FD'.

FILES
------
There are no configuration files.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
   Success

*1*::
   Failure (syntax or usage error; configuration error; document
   processing failure; unexpected error)
